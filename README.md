# Color Minesweeper

**Color\_Minesweeper** is a new type of Minesweeper game developed in Delphi. It builds upon the original Minesweeper concept by increasing the difficulty, requiring players to identify mines of different colors. Based on the numbers on the minefield map, players can determine the number of mines in adjacent squares. Additionally, the color of the numbers helps players identify the colors of the mines. For example, if the number on the map is yellow, then the surrounding mines must be a combination of green and red. The game interface is shown in the image.
